# SCALE-REU
This is the github repository for the first part of my project that focuses on bayesian optimization and gaussian noise for a small N number of drones. I learned from this part that optimizing drone newtork connectivity was not heavily influenced by coupling strength or gaussian noise, the key is topology. The right network topology can completely stabilize drones at a reasonable synchronicity % despite real world connectvity problems or issue. 

These findings are why I decided to pivot my project to investigating network topology, and if there was a simpler way to achieve a regular coupling strength without the need for a costly all to all topology that takes up too many resources and battery life, which are the biggest cost identifiers when it comes to drone missions.
